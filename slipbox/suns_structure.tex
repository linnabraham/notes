Refer to Article 11 that I submitted to airis magazine.

Through observations done during eclipses people found a colorful ring around the Sun which is called the chromosphere and also a halo of light similar to a crown that is called the Corona.
\unsure{Were observations of the Sun's interior possible?}
People found transient events on the surface called prominences.
More observations and understanding of the Sun's atmospheric \unsure{How do we define the atmosphere?} layers came with the advent of space missions.
