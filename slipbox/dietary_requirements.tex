    We need 0.8 g of protein \footnote{\url{https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-much-protein-do-you-need-every-day-201506188096}}
    for every kg of body weight.
    My weight has been steady at almost 60 kg for sometime now. Thus I need 48 g of protein every day.
    An egg contains between 6 to 7 grams of protein.
    Thus eating 8 eggs daily can fill the need for protein but usually I only have egg once a day and that too two eggs.
    So on days when I don't have eggs, I need to have at least 48 g of protein from other sources.
    I think having chicken once (3 pieces) might fill this need.
