In 1859 Maxwell published an expression for the distribution of the speeds of
particles in a gas which he obtained by analysing collision processes between
the particles. Previously, people had speculated that the particles of the gas all
moved with the same speed; he showed that there could be a distribution of
speeds, and calculated the distribution. Subsequently, Boltzmann (1877) treated
the kinetic theory of gases from a microscopic point of view using notions of
probability. He was able to derive Maxwell's distribution of speeds and to relate
it to the temperature of the particles. In this chapter we treat the particles using
quantum mechanics and derive the Maxwell distribution of speeds.\unsure{How does he arrive at same relation if using QM? What gives?}\\
