\begin{itemize}
	\item What is overfitting in terms of training and validation loss?
\par
For deciding if the model is overfitting or not you need to compare
both training and validation loss curves. If instead of moving hand in hand,
the curves are diverging significantly, the model has started to overfit.
If the validation loss is coming down every epoch, the model has not yet overfit.
