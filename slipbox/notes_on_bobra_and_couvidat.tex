	\begin{itemize}
		\item Authors mentioned that SVM performs better than neural networks, but that is on the extracted parameters from the images not on the images themselves. 
		\item We could look into better feature selection strategies. They assumed independence between the features. Incorporate more features that have come up ever since the paper. 
		\item Anything other than AR that we could use?  How different would the data from Aditya L1 look? 
		\item How do we know if the system is a predictable one? If so, how far into the future? How do we know the answers to these?
		\item How do we make a vector magnetogram measurement? How is the non line-of-sight component measured?
